Just some notes

* IDEA: An application that can ingest a URL, extract the text (and eventually, certain markup such as headers, emphasis, alt-text, etc.), and read the text content using a text-to-speech library. It's going to be nearly entirely dependent on how powerful and natural-sounding a text-to-speech system is available in terms of growing beyond a hobby, but gnuspeech seems promising. 
* The final (v.1) project: An mobile (and perhaps web) application that would allow someone to listen to (for example) Bill Simmons weekly NFL picks while walking, instead of looking at their phone and bumping into things - basically, podcastify web pages. It would be a natural fit for the URX App Search API.
